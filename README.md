#Puzzles


One of my hobies is to solve programming Puzzles, that are asked at various places.
This *repo* contains some of them.They are all jumbled together because I didnt want to create seperate repos for each Puzzle.

#####So...
I Hope some one might benefit from this code or if any one can find some good improvements to these solutions, you can message me.

###How they are orderd.
The main folders denote the, site or contest these questinos are taken form.
This folder contains a *readme* that explanes where they are taken form.
Subfolders are created for each question.


Most question have *readme* that clearly explanes the question.
