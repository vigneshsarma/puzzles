#Prime Number Summation Puzzle

###Puzzle Description
The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output to standard out the sum of all the primes below the value given in the input file.
###Input specifications

The input file will contain a single positive integer (in base 10) expressed as a string using standard ASCII text (e.g. for example, the number “15” but without the double quotes). This number may or may not be padded on either side with white space. There will be no commas, periods, or any other non-numeric characters present within the number. The file may or may not terminate in a single new line character (“\n”). An example input file is below:
`10`
###Output specifications

Find the sum of all the primes below the value given as input.
The result must be printed out as an integer and followed by a single new line.
Example Output (newline after number):
`17`

###Test Cases

Your program will be executed as follows (example is for a Ruby submission):
`./euler10.rb a.in`
